### Project Description
A Bluetooth chat app that lets you send messages to nearby users with the app, where the words are sent in a jumbled manner.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
When people are very close to each other, they usually talk verbally instead of using a chat app, and the conversation is easily understood. 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Create an app that connects people sitting very close to each other. The messages are also jumbled so that the conversation is not easily understood.
